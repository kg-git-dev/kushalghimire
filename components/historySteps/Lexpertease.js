                  The opportuinity to join a law firm and handle it's tech expansion was quite intriguing due to my fascination with the law. However, it required a solid entry strategy. At that time period, law firms in Nepal had no online presence. This has largely changed due to Lexperteases' loud and impactful entry into Nepal's law technology market.  
                  <br />My idea for market entry was to focus on divorce cases. A quick look up in google trend showed incrementally increasing search volume on divorce process. The legal team wrote a lengthy, detailed article on the process of getting divorced and we quickly started dominating the search rankings. Also, since we were first to make entry, google ad words with target of phone calls had unbelievably cheap pricing and led to frequent inbound leads.
